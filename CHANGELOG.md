# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog also serves as a learning record, documenting not just what changed but why—showing the evolution of thinking over time.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Initial public release
- Core specification documents
- Authorization State Machine (ASM-1): 17 states, 12 events, 7 invariants
- Eligibility Capsule schema (EC-1)
- Worked Example Trace
- Validation oracle with 12 invariants
- Glossary of terms

### Context
This version represents the formalization of principles developed over approximately one year of exploration. The architecture emerged from:
1. Personal need for cognitive support systems
2. Deep practice in human-AI collaboration
3. Iterative refinement through dialogue with AI systems

### Key Insights
- Separating eligibility from authorization prevents premature commitment
- Recovery must be structural (not optional) to enable sustainable operation
- Anti-coercion as a design principle changes everything downstream
- Constraint-based design ("negative space") reveals system boundaries

## Future Plans
- Expand infrastructure layer specifications
- Add more worked examples
- Develop Fascia and Brain review protocols
- Create interactive demos

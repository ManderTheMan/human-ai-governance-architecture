## Purpose & Scope

This system is designed as a **cognitive prosthetic**: a structure that preserves agency, continuity, and alignment across time, complexity, and interruption—without coercion, urgency, or collapse.

### Primary Goals

- Prevent context loss
- Decouple reasoning from execution
- Enable safe, intentional action
- Support long-horizon cognition
- Maintain sovereignty under pressure

### This Is NOT

- A productivity system
- A task manager
- An autonomous agent

It is an **alignment-first coordination architecture**.

## Design Philosophy

### Augmentation Over Automation

The system augments human cognition, not automates it.

- AI may assist, analyze, mirror, or suggest
- AI may not decide, execute, or override by default

### Contextual Authority

No component has inherent authority. Authority is granted by context.

### Execution as Privileged Act

Execution is treated as irreversible, energy-consuming, and optionality-reducing. Therefore it requires preserved context, bounded scope, explicit consent, and readiness signals.

### Stillness as Valid State

The system recognizes stillness, pause, and recovery as productive states.
